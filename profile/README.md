# Welcome to the OrleansMC Organization!

This organization hosts open-source projects originally developed for the OrleansMC Minecraft server network. Following the server's shutdown, these are shared for transparency, education, and community use.

> **Note:** These projects were built for internal use and may be tightly coupled to our original infrastructure, lack full documentation, or have incomplete features.

## Our Projects

*   **[OrleansMC](https://github.com/OrleansMC/OrleansMC)**: Foundational Paper/Velocity plugin for player data, server state (Redis), cross-server communication, and more.
*   **[OrleansRealms](https://github.com/OrleansMC/OrleansRealms)**: Paper plugin for a realm system with custom climates, member management, and progression, integrating with Quests, ItemsAdder, etc.
*   **[OrleansCommands](https://github.com/OrleansMC/OrleansCommands)**: Paper plugin with QoL commands for VIPs (crafting, repair, skins) with cooldowns and LuckPerms integration.
*   **[OrleansBot](https://github.com/OrleansMC/OrleansBot)**: Node.js Discord bot for server-Discord integration (player info, admin commands, tickets, logging).
*   **[OrleansMC Website](https://github.com/OrleansMC/OrleansWebsite)**: Community website (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS) for news, guides, profiles, store, and Discord OAuth, using MongoDB, MySQL, and Redis.

## Infrastructure Overview
